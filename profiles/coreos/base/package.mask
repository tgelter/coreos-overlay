# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# mask an accidental rkt major version bump to ensure it's not chosen over more
# recent releases
=app-emulation/rkt-13.0

# Since version 2, it tries to write liblto symlinks with absolute paths that
# don't work when building for the board root directories.
>=sys-devel/gcc-config-2

# mask libcrypt-2 to prevent glibc from being updated to 2.31
